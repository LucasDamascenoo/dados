# 📝 Project Task
# The program should:

# Repeatedly prompt the user to type something.

# Save each input to a file (one input per line).

# Stop asking when the user types "exit" (case-insensitive).

# This type of pattern — getting user input and writing it to a file — is useful for things like logs, note-taking apps, or command-line tools.


# while True:

#     user_input = input('O que deseja escrever? ')

x = 10
print(id(x))  # mostra o endereço de memória

x += 1        # cria um NOVO objeto com valor 11
print(id(x))
